			<h1>Problems:</h1>

				<br>

				<p>- People limit themselves due to COVID-19 requiring people to stay six feet away from each other. Some people ignore this however in order to satisfy their own urges, but if pointed out, or if the extra safety measures are not that cumbersome, they would likely comply. People need to be reminded of the importance of wearing masks and staying six feet away from each other. </p>


				<br>

				<p>- With the current covid risks and restrictions people arenâ€™t able to leave their house.  People have been unable to participate in the normal tasks that they often find necessary for satisfaction and enjoyment in day to day life. People have felt often bored and isolated with the lack of entertainment because everything is closed. Another big reason for the feeling of isolation is not being able to see other people and have face to face interaction. </p>

				<br>

			<h1>Solutions:</h1>

				<br>
				
				<p>- People can be reminded of the safety standard in a variety of ways, but having it highlighted when they first visit a website will reaffirm that the idea is in their mind. On top of that, showcasing how small six feet is, alongside how people are free to have their own mask design, the masks are not limiting their freedom nor how they can express themselves. </p>

				<br>

				<p>- The key solution is providing possible forms of entertainment for people feeling isolated and locked up. This could come in the form of recommendations of outside activities that can be easily spaced out. Other recommendations  can be virtual activities or other in person events that meet current covid guidelines. Another source of entertainment we will provide is a sample game on our website that can be used as a time passer when needed. </p>
