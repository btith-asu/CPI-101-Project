			<h1>Patrick Mclean</h1>
			<p>
			
			I am from Maple Grove, MN. I am majoring in Informatics with a minor in Economics. I was drawn to Informatics because I have alwasy enjoyed working with technology, math and data. I feel that informatics will be a good fit because it combines those ideas into one field. Minoring in economics will allow me to gain both business and more analatyical skills. I am also running Cross Country and Track here at ASU. Running is another important thing for me and something I hope to continue as my life progresses.
